S# 🧪 Quick Test: Did My Contribution Work?

Follow these simple steps to verify your contribution was successful!

## Step 1: Check Your PR Status ✅

After submitting your PR, look for:
- 🟢 **Green checkmarks** next to your PR (means validation passed)
- 💬 **Welcome comment** from the bot
- 🚫 **No merge conflicts** (there shouldn't be any!)

## Step 2: After Your PR is Merged 🎉

### Immediate (1-2 minutes)
1. **Look for the GitHub Action**: 
   - Go to the [Actions tab](../../actions)
   - You should see "Update Contributors" running or completed
   - Green checkmark = success! ✅

### Within 5 minutes
2. **Check if you're in the README**:
   - Go back to the [main page](../../)
   - Scroll down to "Contributors" section
   - **Search for your name**: Press `Ctrl+F` (or `Cmd+F`) and type your GitHub username
   - You should see your profile picture! 🖼️

3. **Check the badge count**:
   - Look for this badge: ![Contributors](https://img.shields.io/badge/all_contributors-310-orange.svg)
   - The number should have increased by 1
   - Click the badge to jump directly to contributors section

## Step 3: Celebrate! 🎉

## ❌ Troubleshooting: "I Don't See My Profile"

### Check These First:
1. **Was your PR merged?** (Look for purple "Merged" badge)
2. **Did the GitHub Action run?** (Check [Actions tab](../../actions))
3. **Any validation errors?** (Look at the Action logs)

### Common Issues:

**🔧 JSON Format Error**
```json
❌ Wrong:  { name: "John Doe" }           // Missing quotes
✅ Right:  { "name": "John Doe" }         // Proper JSON
```

**🔧 Filename Mismatch**
```
❌ Wrong:  contributors/john.json + "github": "johndoe"
✅ Right:  contributors/johndoe.json + "github": "johndoe"
```

**🔧 Missing Required Fields**
```json
❌ Wrong:  { "name": "John" }
✅ Right:  {
  "name": "John Doe",
  "github": "johndoe", 
  "contributions": ["code"]
}
```

### Still Need Help?

   ```bash
   python3 scripts/validate-contributor.py
   ```
