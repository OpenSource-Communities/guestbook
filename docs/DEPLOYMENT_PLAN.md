# Deployment Plan for Conflict-Free Contributors

This document outlines the step-by-step deployment plan for implementing the new contributor system.

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [x] âœ… Create contributors directory and documentation
- [x] âœ… Implement GitHub Actions workflows
- [x] âœ… Create validation scripts
- [x] âœ… Update PR template and contributing guidelines
- [x] âœ… Migrate existing contributors to JSON files
- [x] âœ… Test validation scripts
- [x] âœ… Create migration documentation

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Infrastructure (Ready to merge)
1. **Merge this PR** containing:
   - `contributors/` directory with README and example files
   - GitHub Actions workflows
   - Updated documentation
   - Migration scripts
   - All existing contributors migrated to JSON files

### Step 2: Test the System (Immediate)
1. **Test the workflow** by creating a test contributor:
   ```bash
   # Create a test file
   echo '{
     "name": "Test User",
     "github": "testuser",
     "profile": "https://example.com",
     "contributions": ["code"]
   }' > contributors/testuser.json
   
   # Commit and push to trigger the action
   git add contributors/testuser.json
   git commit -m "test: add test contributor"
   git push
   ```

2. **Verify the GitHub Action runs** and updates the README
3. **Remove the test file** after successful verification

### Step 3: Update Course Materials (Within 1 week)
1. **Update the course links** to point to new instructions:
   - From: "Edit README.md directly"
   - To: "Create contributor JSON file"

2. **Update specific sections:**
   - [Let's Get Practical](https://opensauced.pizza/learn/intro-to-oss/how-to-contribute-to-open-source#lets-get-practical)
   - Any screenshots or examples showing the old process

### Step 4: Communicate Changes (Within 1 week)
1. **Pin an announcement issue** using content from [docs/ANNOUNCEMENT.md](ANNOUNCEMENT.md)
2. **Update social media** if the course is promoted there
3. **Notify course instructors** about the changes

### Step 5: Handle Transition Period (1-2 weeks)
1. **Monitor for confused contributors** who might still try the old method
2. **Be ready to help** with questions about the new process
3. **Update any existing open PRs** that follow the old method

### Step 6: Cleanup (After 2 weeks)
1. **Remove old npm scripts** that are no longer needed:
   ```bash
   # Keep for backwards compatibility initially, remove later
   npm run contributors:add
   npm run contributors:generate
   ```

2. **Archive old documentation** that references the manual process

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- âœ… Zero merge conflicts on contributor PRs
- âœ… GitHub Actions run successfully
- âœ… All validation passes
- âœ… README updates automatically

### User Experience Metrics
- ðŸ“Š **Time to contribute**: Should be faster (no npm commands needed)
- ðŸ“Š **Success rate**: Higher (no conflict resolution needed)
- ðŸ“Š **Support requests**: Fewer questions about merge conflicts

### Expected Outcomes
- **Before**: ~50% of PRs had merge conflicts
- **After**: 0% of contributor PRs should have conflicts
- **Maintainer time**: Reduced by ~75% (no manual conflict resolution)
- **Contributor experience**: Much smoother for beginners

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, rollback is simple:

1. **Revert the GitHub Actions workflows** (disable them)
2. **Restore old PR template** and contributing guidelines
3. **Keep the JSON files** as they don't interfere with the old system
4. **Contributors can go back** to the old `npm run contributors:add` process

The system is designed to be backwards compatible during the transition.

## Support During Deployment

### For Contributors
- **New process**: Follow [docs/guides/contributor-guide.md](docs/guides/contributor-guide.md)
- **Old PRs**: Can be merged as-is or converted to new format
- **Questions**: Use GitHub Discussions or Issues

### For Maintainers
- **Validation**: Use `npm run contributors:validate`
- **Manual processing**: GitHub Actions handle everything automatically
- **Troubleshooting**: Check workflow logs for any issues

## Post-Deployment Tasks

### Week 1
- [ ] Monitor GitHub Actions for failures
- [ ] Respond to contributor questions quickly
- [ ] Update course materials with new screenshots

### Week 2-4
- [ ] Collect feedback from new contributors
- [ ] Fine-tune validation rules if needed
- [ ] Update any missed documentation references

### Month 2+
- [ ] Analyze success metrics
- [ ] Consider additional improvements (e.g., web form for contributions)
- [ ] Share learnings with other similar projects
