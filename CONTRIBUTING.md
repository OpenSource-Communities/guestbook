# Contributing Guidelines

This repository is part of the [Intro to Open Source course](https://opensauced.pizza/learn/intro-to-oss/). We recommend you take and complete the course before you contribute to this repository.

Contributions are always welcome, no matter how large or small. Before you begin, please read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/OpenSource-Communities/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and follow the directions below:

## ðŸŽ‰ Adding Yourself as a Contributor

ðŸ“– To add yourself as a contributor to the guestbook, please **see [docs/guides/contributor-guide.md](docs/guides/contributor-guide.md) for detailed instructions and examples**

## Recommended Communication Style

1. Always leave screenshots for visual changes.
